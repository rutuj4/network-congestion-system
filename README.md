<h1>OpenGL project on the Network Congestion System</h1>


 Congestion is a situation in Communication Networks in which too many packets are present in a part of the subnet, performance degrades.
 In data networking network congestion occurs when a link or node is carrying so much data that its quality of service deteriorates.
 
 Congestion control concerns controlling traffic entry into a telecommunications network, so as to avoid congestive collapse by attempting 
 to avoid oversubscription of any of the processing or link capabilities of the intermediate nodes and networks and taking resource reducing steps, 
 such as reducing the rate of sending packets.
 It should not be confused with flow control, which prevents the sender from overwhelming the receiver.
